This file is to supplement any tutorials on Django.
The directory is structured as follows:

whiteboard(referred as [project] in tutorials)
|
|   whiteboard
|   |
|   |settings.py --> This is where general settings are defined. Toggle debugging, and establishes database
|   |__init__.py --> For scripts to run on startup
|   |urls.py     --> Defines base level url paths for different apps
|   |wsgi.py     --> Ignore this
|
|   canvas (referred to as app in tutorials)
|   |
|   |migrations  --> This directory will construct all database objects automatically based on classes defined in models.py
|   |static      --> This is where all CSS and JavaScript files will be
|   |admin.py    --> Creates models with admin privileges
|   |apps.py     --> Config file, ignore
|   |test.py     --> Unit testing goes here
|   |models.py   --> This is where all database objects will be defined as classes
|   |views.py    --> Handles all backend functionality and its relation to frontend (i.e. POST, GET, forms, scripts, etc..)
|   |forms.py    --> Similar to models but for forms
|
|   templates   --> This is where all Django HTML files will be located
Any additional files can be put anywhere
